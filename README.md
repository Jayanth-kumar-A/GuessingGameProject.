🎲 Number Guessing Game
📌 Project Overview

This is a simple text-based number guessing game developed in Java as part of the Cognifyz Internship (Level 1, Task 1).
The game demonstrates the use of conditional statements, loops, and random numbers in Java programming.

🚀 How the Game Works

The computer randomly selects a number.

The player enters guesses until they find the correct number.

The program gives hints:

Too Low → if guess is smaller.

Too High → if guess is larger.

The game ends when the player guesses correctly, and the total number of attempts is displayed.

🛠️ Features

Random number generation 🎲

User input using Scanner

Hints for each guess (higher/lower)

Attempt counter 📊

Beginner-friendly code with comments

📝 Example Gameplay
🎲 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I have chosen a number between 1 and 100.
Can you guess it?
Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 62
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
